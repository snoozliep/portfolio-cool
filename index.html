            <h1>Hi, It's <span>Turbo Granny</span></h1>
            <h3 class="typing-text">I am a Yokai <span></span></h3>
            <p>Turbo Granny (ターボババア Tābo Babā?) is a well-known yokai that was 
                previously within a tunnel located at Shono City until her 
                confrontation with Momo Ayase and Okarun. After having her powers sealed within Okarun, along with her consciousness being trapped inside a stuffed doll, Turbo Granny makes a deal with Momo to help Okarun find his kintama in exchange for having her powers back.
                In Dandadan, she served as the primary antagonist during the Turbo Granny Arc but has since become a major supporting character throughout the series.</p>

                        <h3>Personality</h3>
                        <p>Turbo Granny is a yokai that acts cruel, sadistic, and is extremely foul-mouthed. She is also rather somewhat vulgar, as she offered Okarun a chance to suckle on her breasts in exchange for consuming his family jewels. Since she possesses impressive running power, Turbo Granny takes great pride in her speed and refuses to be underestimated. When challenged to prove herself, she is not above using trickery to get her way, having been deceitful with Okarun and Momo in their game of tag by counting irregularly. Despite her negative attitude, she is revealed to have a compassionate side, as Seiko stated that Turbo Granny would most commonly wander off to spirits of girls who died tragically in order to comfort them, which was the reason as to why she fused with the Earthbound Spirit Crab within Shono City.</p>

                        <p>During modern times, the Turbo Granny was a yokai known as the 100 km/hr Granny (100キロババア 100 Kiro Babā?) that went around terrorizing the people of Japan. While wandering about, the Turbo Granny comforted the spirits of deceased girls who died horrible deaths and eventually fused with an earthbound spirit within a tunnel in Shono City and would curse those who would dare enter her territory by stealing their reproductive organs.</p>

                        <h3>Trivia</h3>
                        <p>Turbo Granny is a modern urban legend throughout Japan, featuring in multiple locations across the country and performing various unusual tasks. The common feature is that the figure involved moves at least as fast as a car and is more often than not an old woman, though there is some variation on that.
                            She is probably based on the mythical practice of Ubasute, which involved elderly women being abandoned in a remote and desolate place by younger family members in times of hardship to reduce the number of mouths to fed. Though never having been widely practiced, it can be found in stories and foklore. It would further explain why she acts so angry around Momo and Okarun often complaining about their disrespect for the elderly.</p>

                    <p>Momo's interactions with Turbo Granny often highlight a generational gap. Turbo Granny's anger towards Momo stems from her frustration with the younger generation's perceived disrespect for traditions and elders. This tension serves as a comedic yet poignant commentary on how youth can sometimes overlook the wisdom and experiences of older generations.</p>

                    <p>While Turbo Granny may express anger and frustration towards the younger generation, Momo's Grandma might take a more understanding and nurturing approach, highlighting different perspectives on aging and respect.</p>

                    <p>Okarun's relationship with Turbo Granny often involves him being the mediator. He may try to appease Turbo Granny while also encouraging Momo to be more respectful. His character embodies the struggle of balancing modern youth culture with traditional values.</p>
